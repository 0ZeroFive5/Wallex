# Wallex

An open-source alternative to [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en).

Currently, there is no custom API.

But since Wallex is using electron, you can do whatever you please with it.

This project is based on: [electron-wallpaper](https://github.com/cjsewell/electron-wallpaper)
